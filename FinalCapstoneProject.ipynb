        "This project will help solve the problem of where to open a salad shop in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. I will use Foursquare's location data to find out where salad shops are currently located. I will then use a JSON file containing data about the boundaries of neighborhoods to figure out which neighborhoods might have more salad eaters than salad shops. This project would be of interest to the stakeholders of a salad chain such as Chopt, as well as to small business owners who are researching where to open a new location. "

To get this, I will use the module Nominatim from the geopy.geocoders package. I will search Manhattan, New York as an input and will get the latitude and longitude coordinates of Manhattan in return. I will set the returned values to the variables manhattan_latitude and manhattan_longitude, respectively. These variables will be used for the entirety of the project as the central location data. \n",
